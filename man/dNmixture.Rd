\arguments{
\item{x}{count observation data. 0 and positive integers}

\item{lambda}{expected value of the Poisson distribution of true abundance}

\item{prob}{observation probability for each X}

\item{Nmin}{the minimum abundance to sum over. Set to -1 for distribution
to select based on lambda}

\item{Nmax}{the maximum abundance to sum over. Set to -1 for distribution
to select based on lambda}

\item{len}{The length of the x vector}

\item{log}{TRUE or 1 to return log probability. FALSE or 0 to return probability.
Need not be specified in the model context.}

\item{n}{number of random draws, each returning a vector of length
\code{len}. Currently only \code{n = 1} is supported, but the
argument exists for standardization of "\code{r}" functions.}

\value{
For \code{dNmixture_s} and \code{dNmixture_v}: the probability (or likelihood) or log
probability of observation vector \code{x}.

\description{
\code{dNmixture_s} and \code{dNmixture_v} provides dynamic occupancy model distributions for NIMBLE models.
}
\details{
These nimbleFunctions provide distributions that can be used directly in R or
in \code{nimble} hierarchical models (via \code{\link[nimble]{nimbleCode}}
and \code{\link[nimble]{nimbleModel}}).

N-mixture models describe abundance at a series of sites over many replicate observations.
The likelihood of an observation in site \code{s} at visit \code{t} depends on the
true abundance N, which is assumed to be drawn from a Poisson distribution with
mean \code{lambda}. It also depends on the probability of detecting an individual
(\code{prob} or \code{prob[t]}). The observed count \code{x[t]} has a probability
according to the Binomial distribution with size parameter N and probability \code{prob}

The distribution has two forms, \code{dNmixture_s} and
\code{dNmixture_v}. These differentiate whether the detection
probability \code{prob} is visit-dependent (a vector, \code{dNmixture_v})
or visit-independent (a scalar, dNmixture_s).

For more explanation, see
\href{../doc/Introduction_to_nimbleEcology.html}{package vignette} (or
\code{vignette("Introduction_to_nimbleEcology")}).

Compared to writing \code{nimble} models with a discrete latent
state of abundance N and a separate scalar datum for each observation time,
use of these distributions allows one to directly sum (marginalize) over
the discrete latent state N and calculate the probability of all
observations for a site jointly.

These are \code{nimbleFunction}s written in the format of user-defined
distributions for NIMBLE's extension of the BUGS model language. More
information can be found in the NIMBLE User Manual at
\href{https://r-nimble.org}{https://r-nimble.org}.

When using these distributions in a \code{nimble} model, the left-hand side
will be used as \code{x}, and the user should not provide the \code{log}
argument.

For example, in \code{nimble} model code,

\code{observedCounts[i, 1:T] ~ dNmixture_v(lambda[i],
prob[i, 1:T],
Nmin, Nmax, T)}

declares that the \code{observedCounts[i, 1:T]} (observed
counts for site \code{i}, for example) vector follows an
N-mixture model distribution with parameters as indicated,
assuming all the parameters have been declared elsewhere in the
model. As above, \code{lambda[i]} is the mean of the abundance distribution at site i,
\code{prob[i, 1:T]} is a vector of detection probabilities at site i, and
\code{T} is the number of observation occasions. This will invoke
(something like) the following call to \code{dNmixture_v} when
\code{nimble} uses the model such as for MCMC:

\code{dNmixture_v(observedCounts[i, 1:T], lambda[i],
prob[i, 1:T],
Nmin, Nmax, T)}

If an algorithm using a \code{nimble} model with this declaration
needs to generate a random draw for \code{observedCounts[1:T]}, it
will make a similar invocation of \code{rNmixture_v}, with \code{n = 1}.

If the observation probabilities are occasion-independent, one would use:

\code{observedCounts[1:T] ~ dNmixture_s(observedCounts[i, 1:T], lambda[i],
prob[i],
Nmin, Nmax, T)}
}

# Set up constants and initial values for defining the model
len <- 5 # length of dataset
dat <- c(1,2,0,1,5) # A vector of observations
lambda <- 10 # mean abundance
prob <- c(0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.4) # A vector of detection probabilities

# Define code for a nimbleModel

   lambda ~ dunif(0, 1000)

   for (i in 1:5) {
     prob[i] ~ dunif(0, 1)

                    data = list(x = dat),
                    inits = list(lambda = lambda,
                                 prob = prob))
# Calculate log probability of data from the model
nmix_model$calculate()
# Use the model for a variety of other purposes...
