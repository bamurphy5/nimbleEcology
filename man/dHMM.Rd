\title{Hidden Markov Model distribution for use in NIMBLE models}
\usage{
dHMM(x, length, init, Z, T, log = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector of observation classes, one of which could be defined as "not observed".}

\item{init}{vector of initial state probabilities}

\item{Z}{time-independent matrix of observation probabilities.
Dimension of \code{Z} is (number of possible observation classes) x (number of possible system states)}

\item{T}{time-independent matrix of system state-transition probabilities.
Dimension of \code{T} is (number of possible system states) x  (number of possible system states)}

\item{log}{TRUE or 1 to return log probability. FALSE or 0 to return probability.}

\item{len}{length of observations (needed for rDHMM)}
}
\description{
\code{dHMM} and \code{dHMMo} provide hidden Markov model distributions for NIMBLE models.
"Dynamic" here means that the matrix of state transition probabilities in indexed by time.  The
\code{dDHMMo} version additionally allows observation probabilities to be indexed by time.
Compared to writing NIMBLE models with discrete latent states, use of these DHMM distributions allows
one to directly integrate over such discrete latent states and hence leave them out of the NIMBLE
model code.

\details{
These nimbleFunctions provide distributions that can be used in code (via \link{nimbleCode})
for \link{nimbleModel}.

These are written in the format of user-defined distributions to extend NIMBLE's
use of the BUGS model language.  More information about writing user-defined distributions can be found
in the NIMBLE User Manual at \code{https://r-nimble.org}.

The first argument to a "d" function is always named \code{x} and is given on the
left-hand side of a (stochastic) model declaration in the BUGS model language (used by NIMBLE).
When using these distributions in a NIMBLE model, the user
should not provide the \code{log} argument.  (It is always set to \code{TRUE} when used
in a NIMBLE model.)

For example, in a NIMBLE model,

\code{observedStates[1:T] ~ dHMM(initStates[1:S], observationProbs[1:O, 1:S],
transitionProbs[1:S, 1:S], T)}

declares that the \code{observedStates[1:T]} vector follows a hidden Markov model distribution
with parameters as indicated, assuming all the parameters have been declared elsewhere in the model.  In
this case, \code{S} is the number of system states and \code{O} is the number of observation classes, and
\code{T} is the number of observation occasions.

If the observation probabilities are time-dependent, one would use:

\code{observedStates[1:T] ~ dDHMM(initStates[1:S], observationProbs[1:O, 1:S, 1:T],
transitionProbs[1:S, 1:S], T)}
