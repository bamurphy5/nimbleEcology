# Distributions for NIMBLE that are useful for ecological models

This repository has *unfinished, untested, incomplete, draft* code for several distributions that can be used in NIMBLE models for common population ecology statistical models.  These include distributions for:

* basic capture-recapture distributions (Cormack-Jolly-Seber),
* hidden Markov model distributions for multi-state and multi-event capture-recapture models,
* occupancy models, and
* dynamic occupancy models.

Community contributions or suggestions for other needs are welcome.

The plan for this repository is to finish the code, documentation and testing and then make it available as an R package on CRAN.

Some of these models were used (in slightly different forms) in:
